A lone archer in weathered bronze armor, face streaked with dirt, draws a longbow with deliberate tension. The arrow releases with a sharp twang. Camera immediately snaps behind the arrow, tracking it in extreme slow motion as it cuts through drifting smoke and falling embers. Shallow depth of field keeps the arrow razor-sharp while the chaotic battlefield blurs behind. The camera pushes closer, tighter, until the wooden shaft fills the frame—revealing intricate carved runes and weathered grain. Seamless transition to macro scale: the arrow's surface becomes a landscape. A microscopic civilization of tiny warriors the size of splinters wages war across the fletching. Miniature catapults hurl fragments of dust. Warriors scale the carved runes like canyon walls. Torches flicker. Banners wave.",

    "promptFull": "GPT Image 2 Prompt:\n\nCreate a raw kung fu performance storyboard focused on extreme physical action. Use reference image for the character.\n\n16:9 storyboard sheet, 12 cinematic panels. The actual storyboard drawings must be black and white only: rough pencil lines, minimal detail, fast gesture drawing energy, simple anatomy construction and strong silhouette readability. Keep the artwork lightweight, dynamic and unfinished like early fight choreography previs.\n\nStart directly in action. Do not begin with a calm stance, preparation shot or slow introduction.\n\nA solitary female performer executes an aggressive Tibetan kung fu master-style routine inside a vast ancient temple. The choreography is exaggerated, explosive and constantly escalating: flying diagonal kicks, monk-style low stances, rapid palm strikes, spinning cloth-like body turns, animal-form hand shapes, deep lunges, aerial twists, floor-level sweeps, sudden drops, claw-like blocks, back-arched jumps, sliding recoveries and violent sculptural impact poses.\n\nEvery panel must contain visible motion and strong body momentum. Avoid static standing poses. The performer should feel like a ritual warrior moving with discipline, fury, spiritual pressure and total body control.\n\nAction progression:\n1. begin mid-air with a flying diagonal kick already in motion\n2. handheld close-up palm sweep cutting through air\n3. orbiting wide shot of a full-body spin\n4. low-angle impact palm strike with shockwave\n5. long-lens side profile spinning kick\n6. top-down aerial turn with body, hair and fabric flaring outward\n7. hard floor stomp cracking the temple stone\n8. sliding low sweep across the floor\n9. aggressive close-up flurry of elbows, palms and backfist strikes\n10. extreme low monk-style beast stance with energy rising\n11. spinning elemental vortex around the body\n12. final airborne action pose, suspended above the temple floor, body twisted in a powerful kung fu strike, all elements converging around her before impact\n\nAdd selective elemental energy effects as VFX-style storyboard accents. The effects should feel spiritual, ritualistic and cinematic, not superhero-like:\nair bursts around spins and flying kicks,\ndust and stone fragments lifting from stomps,\nwater-like floor ripples during slides,\nfire-like trails around explosive strikes,\nheat distortion around high-intensity movement,\nelemental vortex near the climax.\n\nElement progression:\nearly panels: subtle wind, dust and pressure lines\nmiddle panels: stronger stone fragments, floor ripples and air shockwaves\nlate panels: controlled fire trails and energy spirals\nfinal panel: the strongest combined elemental surge while the performer is still airborne\n\nUse cinematic arthouse action camerawork:\nhandheld energy,\nwhip-pan feeling,\norbiting camera moves,\noverhead shots,\nside silhouettes,\naggressive close-ups,\nlong-lens compression,\nextreme low angles,\nwide negative space,\nstrong parallax.\n\nKeep the temple environment minimal and atmospheric:\ntowering stone columns,\nworn temple floor,\ndrifting incense smoke,\nhanging fabric,\nharsh light shafts,\nfaint dust in the air,\nsubtle wet floor reflections.\nDo not overcrowd the frames.\n\nAnnotation color system:\nred arrows = body movement\nblue arrows = camera movement\ngreen marks = framing / composition notes\norange marks = lighting direction\nyellow marks = elemental VFX / energy effects\nblack text = short lens notes and panel labels\n\nNo timestamps. No dialogue. No singing. No extra characters. No enemies. No logos. No watermark.\n\n\nSeedance 2.0 Prompt:\n\nCreate a 15-second cinematic kung fu performance video.\n\nUse @[image1]  as the fixed character sheet reference. The character must strictly match the character sheet.\nUse @[image2]  as the storyboard reference.\n\nFollow the storyboard shot by shot as the main source for action order, camera rhythm, body movement, framing, movement direction, camera angles and visual progression. Treat each storyboard panel as a sequential keyframe. Preserve the shot order and make the video feel like the storyboard has been translated into continuous live-action motion. The sequence must end on a frozen final frame while the performer is still airborne.\n\nDo not add text, captions, storyboard labels, arrows, UI, logos or watermarks. Do not treat the storyboard as a single image. Do not redesign the character, change the costume or alter the face. Do not begin with a calm stance, preparation pose or slow introduction. Do not make the elemental effects look like superhero powers or excessive fantasy glow.\n\nVisual style:\nstylized cinematic realism, high-end 3D painterly animation quality, dynamic cloth simulation, expressive silhouette design, rich cinematic lighting, controlled color palette, natural motion blur, dramatic scale, beautiful but aggressive physicality, premium feature-animation aesthetic.\n\nEnvironment:\nvast ancient temple, towering stone columns, worn temple floor, drifting incense smoke, hanging fabric, harsh light shafts, faint dust in the air, subtle wet floor reflections, high contrast shadows.\n\nThe performance is a solitary female kung fu routine inside a vast ancient temple. The routine starts immediately in action, with no calm stance, no preparation pose and no slow introduction. The movement should feel aggressive, ritualistic, disciplined, physically extreme and spiritually charged.\n\nThis is not a fight against an enemy. It is a solo performance of force, control, exhaustion, fury and release.\n\nFollow story board for choreography direction.\n\nElement progression:\nearly sequence: subtle wind, dust and pressure lines responding to movement.\nmiddle sequence: stronger air shockwaves, stone fragments, floor cracks and water-like ripples across the temple floor.\nlate sequence: controlled fire trails, heat distortion and energy spirals around explosive strikes and kicks.\nclimax: wind, dust, stone, water ripple and fire accents combine into a stronger elemental vortex.\nfinal beat: the performer is airborne above the temple floor in a powerful kung fu strike, body twisted mid-air, hair and fabric flaring outward, with all elements converging around her before impact.\n\nElemental VFX must feel spiritual, ritualistic and cinematic. The effects should be integrated with the choreography and motivated by physical movement. Keep the energy raw, elemental, atmospheric and grounded in the temple environment.\n\nUse Laban movement logic throughout:\nweight: strong, heavy, grounded during impacts, with brief lightness during jumps and aerial twists\ntime: quick during strikes, kicks, drops and turns, sustained during suspended holds and recovery transitions\nspace: direct during attacks, blocks and lunges, indirect during spinning turns and elemental vortex moments\nflow: bound during rooted stances and precise strikes, free during aerial motion, spinning fabric movement and elemental release",
